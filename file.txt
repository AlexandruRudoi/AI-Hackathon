Judd Trump will face Ding Junhui in the final of the World Open in Yushan, China.
Defending World Open champion Trump beat world number 52 Jackson Page 6-2 to book his place in Sunday's final.
China's Ding won 6-5 against Neil Robertson as he twice came from behind to win his semi-final.
The final will be the first time the two have met in a competitive final since the 2014 German Masters, which Ding won 8-5.
In the first semi-final, Trump produced a break of 122 to take an early lead but Wales' Page, playing in his first ever semi-final at a ranking event, showed he was capable of providing a test for the Englishman.
They were level at 2-2 but Trump then took control, winning the final four frames.
World number two Trump has now reached back-to-back World Open finals, having won the most recent edition in 2019.
World number nine Ding and Australian world number 15 Robertson played out a thriller in the second semi-final, with Robertson making two breaks of over 100 (118 and 128).
Ding fought back from 4-1 and then 5-4 down to win in the final frame. Like Trump, Ding is a one-time World Open champion, winning it in 2017.
Trump will be aiming for his fifth title of the season in Sunday's final before the World Championships start next month in Sheffield.
